# TimeCard
#### Simple ASP.NET Core Web API service

TimeCard is the first service created for a simple microservices architecture based ASP.NET Core Enterprise Portal style webapp. TimeCard currently allows you to create a new time card, get a time card by ID, get time cards by employee number, and delete records.

TimeCard uses C#, .NET Core 3.1, EntityFrameworkCore and an Azure hosted SQL Database to provide the functionality for the service.
